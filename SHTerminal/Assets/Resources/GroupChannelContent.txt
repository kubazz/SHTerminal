##T:DISCONNECTING ISSUES
user069:anybody has problems with the-you-know-what-game-.exe disconnecting all the time? I hear you guys play all those levels but it disconnects me after few steps
!DISCOURAGE. HE DIDN'T RECIEVE THE SIGNAL WELL. DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE MESSAGE.
kazz:works fine for me.
MOD:you're really looking for tech support for a pirated piece of soft? you should be more careful.
user069:i just want to shoot some red guys.
MOD:maybe it's not meant for you. THE GAME can be moody. Sometimes it just doesn't work.
user069:lol, what kind of sorcery is this? cannot the game just work, like in the old days?
MOD:it's either ad spamming F2P or pirated F2P.^W3 Pirated sometimes doesn't work, but you live with that.
user069:yep, gonna try again.

poly:so, my most awesome session with - you - know - what. I was in some kind of CEO appartment, I did an execution. He didn't even resist, felt total power. But then the game told me to walk through the window. I felt every second of splashing on the pavement. That was intense.
!GOOD, GREAT POTENTIAL HERE. WE WILL UNLOCK MODS FOR HIM, GET HIM HOOKED.
MOD:good. there's more to it, you should keep playing. everything will make sense in the end. 
poly:guess, i need to go deeper, lol.

#jlllama



lllama:just played the game, had a very strange new level. MOD, you here? want to share.
MOD:yes, I'm here, tell me.
lllama:I was in a jail and the cells started opening and prisoners started running at me. I was a jail guard and started shooting at the prisoners. Then the other guard came and I shot him too. It seemed unusual, those cells opening.


!STANDARD INTRODUCTION SCENE. ENCOURAGE SPECULATION.


MOD:yes, I played the same scene. I was the one who opened the cells.
lllama:so it's like co-op? wicked.
MOD:it's hard to explain. It doesn't let you decide, that's the thing. You sometimes meet other players, but it's random. Most of the time you don't know it until it's already over. Like with this jail, you're telling me about.
lllama:dude, that's trippy.
MOD:be my guest.

kazz:remember mixxer?

rockr:he hanged out here, played so much, but now he just left
!MOD, HANDLE THIS. MIXXER IS WITH US NOW. GENERATE A COVER STORY.
kazz:yeah, he didn't even seem bored with the game. he was excited as ever.

rockr:and the next day ^O^W3 HE'S GONE
kazz:HE'S GONE


rockr:coincidence?
kazz:I ^OTHINK NOT!
MOD:I THINK YES, actually. I spoke with him recently. Had some family issues and got cut from the network
kazz:a fate worse than death. 
rockr:it seems strange, though. he didn't find a way? this guy was a maniac!
MOD:i don't want to gossip, please respect the guy.
rockr:of course, sorry.


kazz:no network...



kazz:[']
