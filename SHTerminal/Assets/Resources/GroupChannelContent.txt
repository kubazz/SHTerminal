##T:DISCONNECTING ISSUES
user069:anybody has problems with the-you-know-what-game-.exe disconnecting all the time? I hear you guys play all those levels but it disconnects me after few steps
kazz:works fine for me.
MOD:you're really looking for tech support for a pirated piece of soft? you should be more careful.
user069:i just want to shoot some red guys.
MOD:maybe it's not meant for you. THE GAME can be moody. Sometimes it just doesn't work.
user069:lol, what kind of sorcery is this? cannot the game just work, like in the old days?
MOD:it's either ad spamming F2P or pirated F2P.^W3 Pirated sometimes doesn't work, but you live with that.
user069:yep, gonna try again.

poly:sorry, nvm.
MOD:ok





kazz:tell it!!!!!!!




MOD:you going to tell it poly, or what?
poly:so, my most awesome session with - you - know - what. I was in some kind of CEO appartment, I did an execution. He didn't even resist, felt total power. But then the game told me to walk through the window. I felt every second of splashing on the pavement. That was intense.
MOD:good. there's more to it, you should keep playing. everything will make sense in the end. 
poly:guess, i need to go deeper, lol.
MOD::).
poly:see ya, I'm going back in.
